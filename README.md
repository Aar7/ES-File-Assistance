This is a User-Defined-Language (UDL) that I made for use in Notepad++.

It highlights various keywords, operators, and delimiters, thereby assisting content creators for Endless Sky.

To add the UDL to your Notepad++ application (on Windows), perform the following steps 
1. Go to C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++, or wherever you have installed Notepad++, and enter the 'userDefineLangs' folder.
2. Place the XML file into that folder, and run Notepad++
3. In the Notepad++ main menu (File | Edit | View | etc...), click on: Language --> User Defined Language (drop-down menu) --> Define your language...
4. In the window (named User Defined Language v.#.#.#.#) that pops up, click 'Import', navigate to the downloaded file, and select it. The UDL is now loaded and ready to use.
5. Close the window.

P.S. You need to select the UDL for every newly created file in Notepad++. So, now, when you click Language after loading the file, it should be selectable from the bottom of the list of UDLs (in alphanumeric order below the aforementioned drop-down list 'User Defined Language').
